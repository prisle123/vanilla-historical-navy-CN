 navy_rework.1.t: "Sea Monster?"
 navy_rework.1.d: "Recently, our Fishing Department has received reports from many fishermen of a giant sea creature near the coastal fishing grounds, which moves fast and is larger than any ship they have ever seen. They were not taken seriously at first, until several fishing boats were head-on by sea monster while fishing at night, and the snowflakes of reports forced the government to react.\n\nA team composed of biologists and naval officers was quickly assembled, and they called nearby whaling ships and some naval patrol ships to search for traces of the sea monster at night. In the first few days, nothing was found, and the investigation team gradually lost patience. Some people blamed this on the ignorance of the fishermen. But a week later, the investigative team finally made progress.\n\nOn a night of full moon, a low humming sound began to appear underwater, which aroused everyone's vigilance. When all the ships aimed their searchlights at the restless sea, everyone saw the fast moving underwater shadow. \"There's no way a creature can swim that fast!\", a marine biologist screamed, but was soon silenced by people's fear of seeing the black shadow getting bigger and bigger. A giant black beast rushed out of the water and overturned several small boats nearby. People looked from the rain and fog caused by the sea monster's ascent, only to find that it was actually a huge submarine, just like the Nautilus portrayed by Jules Verne.\n\nLights came on on the submarine's deck, and the survey team could see some of the crew stepping out of it. A bold patrol ship sailed directly towards the black fish. While everyone was holding their breaths, the crew of the submarine did not show any hostility, but signaled the investigation team to board the ship. On the deck, they saw the captain, Matias Torres, who claimed to be at war with a country called the Osean Federation, but lost all ties with the motherland after a dive. Although no one could understand what he said, they came to an astonishing conclusion that this submarine seemed to use nuclear fission as a source of power, and it has a flight deck and a gun powered by electromagnetic force. Even the strongest warship in the world will be nothing compared to it.\n\nTo supplement the shortage of food on the submarine, Captain Torres reached an agreement with our government to assist our navy until he finds a way to return to his world."

 navy_rework.2.t: "The Last Voyage"
 navy_rework.2.d: "Although many people are still using sailing ships today, it is still very rare to see the majestic appearance of sailing warships. Recently, among the sailors in some ports, a news spread quickly that a cargo ship found a sailing warship flying the American flag not far from our territorial waters. It is said that this ship has three masts, which is very similar to the past frigates, some people believe it is the USS Constitution. However, this obviously raises more doubts. Just a few years ago, she had just completed a global tour under the tow of a minesweeper, and is now exhibited in Boston as a museum.\n\nAs conspiracy spread like wildfire, and the Boston city government confirmed that USS Constitution was mooring in Boston Harbor, some adventurers formed a team to find this aimlessly cruising sailboat on the high seas.\n\nThe team found the warship in a deserted bay with little effort. Surprisingly, this ship is the USS Constitution. They contacted the local government after leaving some people to guard this ship from a distance. The garrison then sent hundreds of troops to surround the ship.\n\nConfirming that there were no signs of life on the deck, an officer boarded USS Constitution with a dozen soldiers. It wasn't until they approached that people discovered that it was installed with several huge propellers, but they were different from all technologies known to mankind. They found several strangely shaped steel objects, one of which was a huge humanoid thing with a naval officer's hat on its top. A soldier waked it by inadvertently touching it. \"This is the commander of USS Constitution and US Military, Capitan Ironsides. Why do you board my ship?\", the head of the machine gave off a dim red light, and after our officer tremblingly reported his name and purpose, Captain Ironsides seemed to let his guard down. \"I apologize for invading your territorial waters, there must be something wrong with our navigation system, but my country is now at war with Communist China and I must go to the front line immediately.\", he said politely.\n\nIn the later conversation, the team learned about the world that Captain Ironsides came from, where breakthroughs in robotics and nuclear technology were made, and there was a great war broke out between the United States and China, and the subsequent nuclear war almost destroyed the entire world. Ironsides and his ship are the only remaining US troops. After we promised to help them as best we could, Captain Ironsides offered to take orders from us for the time being."

 navy_rework.3.t: "A Falling Star"
 navy_rework.3.d: "A meteor fell on an island off the coast, and the huge explosion and flames soaring into the sky could be seen even in some inland cities. The government attaches great importance to this incident. The recovery of meteorite fragments will not only help scientific research, but will also improve the image of the government. The expedition team was commanded by an army major and accompanied by a group of experts and scientists.\n\nThe small island has been deserted for years, and now there are no residents. Some navy ships have blocked the waters around the island. The expedition landed on the island the next morning and began its journey to the depths. In a cloud of dust, the expedition finally reached the center of the island around noon, and they were about to be shocked by what they saw. It was a huge mechanical object with a length of more than one kilometer, almost the size of a small town. It was absolutely impossible to build such a large object with human technology.\n\nThrough some narrow cracks and passages, the team successfully entered the interior of the object, and some people believed that it might be a huge spaceship built by an alien race. Further investigation confirmed people's conjectures, they found the remains of some tall unknown humanoid creatures, which almost made everyone conclude that it was an alien spacecraft.\n\nUnder the influence of such a major discovery, the government sent a large number of troops to surround the entire island, and countless researchers came to the island to study the spacecraft. However, these technologies are too advanced for humans to understand. After cleaning the interior, the engineering corps repaired the hull as much as it could. Since the hull suffered little damage, the spacecraft was still usable. Our scientists actually managed to activate it by accident, and the automated maintenance machine quickly repaired all malfunctioning equipments. Even its combat system is fully automated.\n\nAlthough we don't know how to use this spacecraft at all now, the government and military are so excited that they named this spacecraft Macross."
